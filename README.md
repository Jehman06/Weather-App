Weather-App

https://jehman06.github.io/weather-app/

It's an app allowing users to check the weather anywhere in the world, and in their favorite unit (Imperial or Metric)!
I used React and Material UI for the UI, and the OpenWeather API for the data. I would love to redesign the UI completely when I have time.

Just type the city you want to check, hit the check! button, and switch from Imperial to Metric using the radio buttons.
